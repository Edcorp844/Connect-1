    content:
        '''If God loves you, then you must be chastened...and when it comes take it positively
don‚Äôt debate to win battles just endure it positively. But the challenge is that we ae
dealing with a victimized church who were abused and used and its up to us ministers
to make that right. Sometimes the things people throw out and the very things other
people take in to use it. (Always the fourth generation forgets God) so we are at the
point where this generation must make a deliberate choice to either light the fire or lose
it. Everyone is and must be a partaker of chastisement...The second mantle is what falls...you have to wait for it to fall then take it up not
taking it upon you by force. Elisha never tried to proclaim himself a prophet during the
days of Elijah. He didn‚Äôt break the ranks. Absalom tried to take the father‚Äôs throne by
stealing his father‚Äôs people. That‚Äôs error. You don‚Äôt build by taking popularity stands
and going behind talking against then later think God‚Äôs hand will be upon them.
Another example is Cain, he killed his brother
The prodigals who force their exist. Luke 15:13 and don‚Äôt wait out their time
Another one is Judas who carry a certain jealousy towards their father. John 12:6 you
should never be jealous of a man if you are sure the Hand of The LORD is upon Him.
If you do, then you will not leave up to his level, if you above them then they will
catch you in rank and over take you. And frustrating the hand that should bless you
causes you to kill your own ministry.
The last one Gehazi who is greedy: He will take what the father can‚Äôt take. If you see your man of God not doing something just don‚Äôt do it also because you are submitted.
We tach more by our actions than our speech. These don‚Äôt know when to say no and when to say yes. So you lose the timing of the spirit. If your father can‚Äôt receive from another hand don‚Äôt receive from it . 2Chron 18:16 and John 10:4-5 Ps 92:13. It‚Äôs not honorable to stand on the pulpit of God with greed in your heart. Zeal and greed look alike but greed has no control but zeal is controlled by The Spirit. Don‚Äôt mix your ground with a variety of many seeds. (Knowing the voices of strangers and also your father)
A minister is not a deep person though depth is part of it. A worshipper is not one with a good voice, we look at the forms and leave God out.2 Cor.13:5 today when the Holy Ghost comes upon them they build more houses and drive more cars but the men of old when The Holy Ghost came upon them and they became witnesses. Acts.1:8. We are supposed to be talking winning souls giving for the gospel doing everything for the gospel. Greed opens up your ears to hear strangers.''',
